# pbureport
Generate a monthly report from a Trello board

* Edit the `boardId` variable in `index.html` to taste.
* Stick this on OpenShift or just a plain web server.
* Open index.html and thrill at your acumen.

## Formatting

The report will reflect the order of the lists and the order of the cards. If you'd like any list or card ignored by the report, just include an exclaimation point (!) or question mark (?) in the title. This will also serve to temper the tone of the report.

`main.css` controls the whole look. There are stubs for all the useful classes and ids.
